# pygame_project

This is my A Level project written in Python. It is a educational game intended for those who find some of the algortihms such as Dijkstra's very abstract and hard to visualise. This game can also be used to test the algorithmic understanding by solving problems that are randomly generated, some of which may have quite a large size.
