# pygame_project

This is my A Level project written in Python. It is an educational game intended for those who find some of the 
algorithms such as Dijkstra's very abstract and hard to visualise. This game can also be used to test the algorithmic 
understanding by solving problems that are randomly generated, although some of which may have too large a size to be 
solved by hand practically, in those cases, one may just randomly generate another puzzle but clicking the restart 
button.

Please run the edu_game.py to play the game.(may need to install the pygame library).

For full details of the project and each step of the iterative development, please consult the write-up document.
